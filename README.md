DataScience's Frontend Code Test
==================

Jason Eriksen's solution for the DataScience at-home exercise for frontend developers. It runs from the local index.html file and uses React for views.

## Instructions

To run on your local machine:

* Clone this repo
* Open public/index.html page in your browser
* ????
* Profit

## Build from source 

The built js files are included in the repo, but you can build from source with these steps:

* install babel `npm install --global babel-cli`
* install dependencies: `npm install`
* build: `npm run build`

## Requirements

Using the provided JSON data representing a collection of meal recipes, create a micro frontend application that meets the following criteria:

* Display a list (or table) of recipes.
* Allow filtering of recipes by a single ingredient.
* Add checkboxes to allow selection of multiple recipes.
* Show an alphabetically ordered list of distinct ingredients for the selected recipes. This should update as recipes are selected / unselected.
* Persist the selections locally and regenerate the view on page refresh.
* In a README note any required setup to be able to run the app, such as modifying hosts file, etc.
