DataScience's Frontend Code Test
==================

My solution for the DataScience at-home exercise for frontend developers. It runs from the local index.html file and uses React for views. To avoid the need for a local server instance, I moved the recipes.json file to a .js file included by the index page.

## Instructions

To run on your local machine:

* Clone this repo
* Open public/index.html page in your browser
* ????
* Profit

## Build from source 

The built js files are included in the repo, but you can build from source with these steps:

* install babel `npm install --global babel-cli`
* install dependencies and build: `npm install && npm run build`
